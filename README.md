# Helping Hands Client

The Helping Hands client is a Non-Profit Donation Marketplace. It was meant to give other non-profits a way to get donations and interact with their community. It's complete with the Stripe payments, user authorization, creation. Non-profit and organization member dashboards coming in later builds.

The user profile page shows the users stats. Donations, organizations they support, events they are attending and in the future medals they have collected. There is a calendar made with [React Calendar](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-calendar#readme). It lists days of events a user is scheduled for.
